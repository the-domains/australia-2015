Jet lag is real.

Easily dismissed on shorter flights and nearby destinations, the almost 12 hour flip flop of day and night really confuses the mind and body.

Forced sunshine-absorbing marches, and pretending everything is perfectly normal even though your body clock screams "WTF is the sun doing up there at this time?", and your bowels are coping with food at toally strange times. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e8f0f3c2-2a9e-4141-8e53-083edc7e3e3f.jpg)

Resisting the urge to fall asleep at 3pm; staying in bed for 4 wakeful hours because not doing so will only lengthen the jet lag.

4 days in and we were all sleeping a bit more regularly, waking up at least near dawn, and enjoying sunset rather than snoring through it.

I took me 2 days in Joe and Trish's house before I had to find out where the light switches were.
